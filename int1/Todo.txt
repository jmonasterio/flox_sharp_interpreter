NUnit won't work.

If parsers has any errors, we should not go to resolver, etc.


use map(), etc instead of loop

expr.AssignExpr is lame. evalExpression should never change the value of the environment. Only a statement should do that.

Book design had a thing called a literal expr.
We have an identifier literal. Maybe identifier should be a literal, not use lexeme.

efficient with really big files?
