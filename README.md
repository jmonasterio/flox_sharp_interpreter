# flox_sharp_interpreter
F# port of JLOX interpreter from the book http://craftinginterpreters.com

I tried to keep to the spirt of the interpreter in the book, but some things are a bit different.

Runs all examples through chapter 12. 

Uses F# from Visual Studio 2017.

Incomplete changes are marked in comments with "TBD".
